# What needs to be done: 
  ## Fixes
    - fix the worlist frase *starting with a space*.
    - fix the wordling option *requiring* an argument: when no chars given focus on all

  ## Functionality
    - Properly utilize stats
    - Generate more than one frase -> generate the next based on the last's stats
    - in "frase mode", enable reading from stdin

  ## Other
    - Unify _letter_ and _char_, probably best to use just one, or use letter in a very specific manner.
